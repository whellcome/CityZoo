# Data Engineering Project: Modernizing Zoo Operations

## Important Update: Script Relocation

The Python application for exporting MS Access databases to SQL format has been **relocated** to a new dedicated repository to enable its focused development and improvement.

### Why the Move?

This script, originally part of the zoo data engineering project, has proven to be a powerful and versatile tool, deserving its own space for growth. It is now actively maintained and developed as a standalone project.

### Where to Find the Script?

The script is now hosted in its new repository:

➡️ [MS Access to SQL Export Tool](https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL)

Please visit the new repository to access the script, contribute, or follow its updates.

The rest of the zoo operations project remains fully functional and continues to focus on its core goals. Thank you for your interest and support!
