# Data Engineering Project: Modernizing Zoo Operations

This repository contains the results of a Data Engineering project aimed at modernizing the operational and analytical systems of the Pirmasens Zoo. The project was conducted as part of a professional assignment to design and implement IT-supported processes for a long-established organization undergoing a comprehensive modernization effort.

## Project Overview

The project addresses key tasks required for implementing integrated data systems in the zoo's operations, focusing on database design, implementation, and data quality assurance. The deliverables are structured into the following objectives:

1. **Operational Database Design (ERM)**  
   - Develop a complete Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the zoo's operational database.  
   - Normalize all many-to-many (M:N) relationships and define primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinalities.

2. **Relational Database Implementation**  
   - Implement the operational database based on the ERM.  
   - Provide comprehensive documentation, including a detailed data dictionary.

3. **Data Warehouse Design and Architecture**  
   - Propose and justify a Data Warehouse schema (e.g., Star, Snowflake, or Data Vault).  
   - Create a corresponding data model and IT architecture to support Business Intelligence (BI) capabilities.

4. **Data Quality Concept**  
   - Develop a strategy to maintain data quality above 97%.  
   - Ensure sustainable processes for data maintenance and error handling.

5. **Project Presentation**  
   - Summarize project results in a structured presentation for stakeholders.  
   - Highlight methodologies, decisions, and best practices.
